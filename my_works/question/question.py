# Quiz 1

"""Add necessary code to file `question.py` before the indicated line so that `Run()` function returns the following string as output:

>Istanbul => (BU, University), (ITU, University), (DSI, HighSchool, German), (GS, HighSchool, French); Konya => (Selcuk, University), (KAL, HighSchool, English)

Your code is expected to pass all the tests. You can use tests as hints, as well. Do not change the given code.

All your code should be written as classes in accordance with object oriented principles. Use polymorphism as much as possible."""
